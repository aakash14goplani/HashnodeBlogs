Based on my learnings from localizing applications in SvelteKit with [*svelte-i18n*](https://blog.aakashgoplani.in/internationalization-in-sveltekit-with-svelte-i18n), [*sveltekit-i18n*](https://blog.aakashgoplani.in/internationalization-in-sveltekit-with-sveltekit-i18n) and [*typesafe-i18n*](https://blog.aakashgoplani.in/internationalization-in-sveltekit-with-typesafe-i18n), I've come up with advantages and limitations of each of these libraries.

### svelte-i18n

#### Features

* It is a simple and minimalistic library that uses [**formatjs**](https://formatjs.io/) for localizing messages and supports the ICU message syntax.
    
* It offers to load translations in a synchronous as well as asynchronous manner as per requirement.
    
* Provides a decent number of options for formatting and pluralization.
    

#### Ease of Use

* Since this library uses native Svelte stores for implementing localization, it feels like part of the ecosystem and hence very easy to get started with!
    
* If you have a simple requirement of changing translations based on a given locale with limited formatting, this should be your go-to library.
    

#### Size

* As of v3.7.0, the size of the *svelte-i18n* package is 48.3 kB in the minified form and 14.2 kB in minified + gzipped form. ([source](https://bundlephobia.com/package/svelte-i18n@3.7.0))
    

#### Community Support

* It has [29,978 downloads/week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-i18n) as of the time of writing this article.
    
* The only downside is, this library is not actively managed. Several issues are on the rise and resolution is almost zero.
    

#### Limitations

* There are very less options available for formatting and pluralization.
    
* As mentioned before, the library is not actively managed.

### sveltekit-i18n

#### Features

* It is **built for SvelteKit** and has good SSR support.
    
* We can load translations from API, database and local file system.
    
* The translations are loaded for visited pages only. (and only once!)
    
* Component-scoped translations: you can create multiple instances with custom definitions.
    
* It provides good TS support and has no external dependencies.
    
* Supports ICU syntax + provides a native parsing engine as well.
    

#### Ease of Use

* It is very easy to use. I found it even easier while working with the ICU parser (instead of the default parser).
    

#### Size

* As of v2.4.2, the size of the *sveltekit-i18n* package is 14 kB in the minified form and 4.6 kB in minified + gzipped form. ([source](https://bundlephobia.com/package/sveltekit-i18n@2.4.2))
    

#### Community Support

* It has [3,052 downloads/week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sveltekit-i18n) as of the time of writing this article.
    
* Even though the number of downloads is less than the *svelte-i18n* but good news is that this library is actively maintained.
    

#### Limitations

* While working with pluralization, understanding the syntax of the default parser could be a bit challenging at the start.

### typesafe-i18n

#### Features

* It is a lightweight, easy-to-use syntax and has no external dependencies.
    
* Because of its strong typings, it prevents you from making mistakes (also in plain JavaScript projects).
    
* Unlike the other two libraries, typesafe-i18n can be used with any framework and supports both TypeScript and JavaScript.
    
* Creates boilerplate code for you which ensures the well-structured flow of i18n in your codebase.
    
* Supports plural rules and allows formatting of values e.g. locale-dependent date or number formats.
    
* It also supports switch-case statements e.g. for gender-specific output.
    
* Provides an option for asynchronous loading of locales.
    
* It supports SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and can be used for frontend, backend and API projects.
    
* Import and Export translations from/to files or services.
    

#### Ease of Use

* It has some initial learning curve but as soon as we become familiar with the *typesafe-i18n* ecosystem, this library is not only easy to use but super convenient as well!
    
* *Personally, this is my go-to library for i18n*.
    

#### Size

* As of v5.26.0, the size of the *typesafe-i18n* package is 2.8 kB in the minified form and 1.3 kB in minified + gzipped form. ([source](https://bundlephobia.com/package/typesafe-i18n@5.26.0))
    

#### Community Support

* It has [13,588 downloads/week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typesafe-i18n) as of the time of writing this article.
    
* This library is actively maintained.
    

#### Limitations

* It has a huge eco-system (generators, detectors, importers, exporters etc.) and hence learning curve is a bit steep.
