Authentication is a critical aspect of web applications, ensuring that users can securely access their accounts and data. In SvelteKit, while there is no built-in authentication system, we can implement robust authentication using various methods such as database credential matching or external OAuth providers. This guide will focus on using SvelteKitAuth and OAuth providers to implement secure authentication in SvelteKit applications. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to set up and manage authentication in SvelteKit.

### **What is SvelteKitAuth?**

* SvelteKitAuth is part of the [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) project - Authentication for Web which is an open-source library that is easy to use.
    
* SvelteKitAuth is an extension of *NextAuth* - a popular authentication framework from the *Next* / *React* world. NextAuth is now getting a major overhaul and is now becoming *Auth.js*
    
* It can be used with any OAuth2 or OpenID Connect provider and has built-in support for 68+ popular services like Google, Facebook, Auth0, Apple etc.
    
* Apart from OAuth authentication, it has built-in support for authentication using email/passwordless/magic link/username/password.
    
* We can configure SvelteKitAuth to use database sessions (MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL, MongoDB etc.) or JWT.
    
* It comes with a built-in security mechanism having features like Signed, prefixed, server-only cookies, has built-in CSRF protection & doesn't rely on client-side JavaScript.
    

### **How does SvelteKitAuth work under the hood?**

To understand how SvelteKitAuth works under the hood, let's explore its internal architecture and the steps involved in the authentication flow.

1. **Configuration**: When setting up SvelteKitAuth, you define a configuration file that specifies authentication providers, such as Google, GitHub, or a custom provider. The configuration also includes settings like secret keys, session storage options, and callback URLs.
    
2. **Authentication Providers**: SvelteKitAuth supports multiple authentication providers, and you can choose the ones you want to enable. Each provider has its configuration options, such as client ID, client secret, scopes, and authorization URLs.
    
3. **Client-Side Flow**: When a user initiates the authentication process, SvelteKitAuth handles the flow by redirecting them to the respective authentication providers login page. This typically involves generating a state and storing it in a server-side session to prevent CSRF attacks.
    
4. **Callback URL**: After successful authentication with the provider, the user is redirected back to a callback URL specified in the SvelteKitAuth configuration. This URL is typically an API route that SvelteKitAuth exposes.
    
5. **Server-Side Flow**: SvelteKitAuth receives the callback request on the specified API route. It validates the received data, including the state parameter, to ensure it matches the stored session state. This step prevents CSRF attacks.
    
6. **Token Exchange**: SvelteKitAuth then exchanges the authorization code received from the authentication provider with an access token. This token allows SvelteKitAuth to make authenticated API requests on behalf of the user.
    
7. **User Information**: With the access token, SvelteKitAuth retrieves the user's profile information from the authentication provider's API. It can fetch details like name, email, profile picture, or any other data that the provider makes available.
    
8. **Session Management**: SvelteKitAuth creates a session for the authenticated user, typically using a secure HTTP-only cookie or a JWT (JSON Web Token). This session contains the user's data and is used for subsequent authenticated requests.
    
9. **Persistent Sessions**: SvelteKitAuth can optionally store session information in a database or other storage mechanisms. This allows users to remain logged in even if the server restarts or the user refreshes the page.
    
10. **Hooks and Events**: SvelteKitAuth provides various hooks and events that you can use to customize the authentication flow, add additional functionality, or integrate with external systems. Examples include the `$page.data.session` for accessing the session data in components and event hooks like `signIn` or `signOut` for performing actions on authentication events.
    

### **Why choose SvelteKitAuth?**

SvelteKitAuth supports **OAuth 1.0**, **1.0A**, **2.0** and **OpenID Connect** and has built-in support for the most popular sign-in services like Google, GitHub, Auth0, Salesforce etc. It also supports multiple popular database adapters like MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL, MongoDB etc. Apart from that it provides a mechanism to create a custom OAuth provider and custom database adapter as well.

Overall, SvelteKitAuth abstracts away the complexities of authentication and provides a unified API for integrating with multiple authentication providers. It handles the authentication flow, token exchange, and session management, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without getting caught up in the intricacies of authentication protocols.
