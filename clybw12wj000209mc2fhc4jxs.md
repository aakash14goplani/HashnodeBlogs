This article demonstrates how to integrate SvelteKitAuth with SvelteKit using OAuth providers, specifically focusing on the Auth0 provider. Before diving into the integration process, it's essential to have an Auth0 application set up. This tutorial will guide you through creating an Auth0 application and configuring it for use with SvelteKitAuth.

### Creating a Auth0 application

Before we start coding, we need to have an Auth0 application. Let's create one.

* Assuming you have a registered account with [**Auth0**](https://auth0.com/), go to the dashboard and on left-hand side navigation, click on "Applications" -&gt; "Create Application".

* Enter the Application name and choose the application type as "Regular Web Applications".

* You should now reach the dashboard page. Click on the "Settings" tab.

* Scroll down to the section "Application URIs" -&gt; "Allowed Callback URLs". A callback URL is a URL that is invoked after OAuth authorization for the consumer. **SvelteKitAuth has a specific pattern for callback URLs** which is `<origin>/auth/callback/providerId` We must follow this pattern. We will enter two values here, one for local development `http://localhost:4000/auth/callback/auth0` and the other for where we host our site `https://my-app.vercel.app/auth/callback/auth0` We can also use a wildcard pattern to whitelist the entire domain: `https://*.vercel.app`.

* The next section will be "Allowed web origins" within "Application URIs" `http://localhost:4000, https://*.vercel.app`
    
* Click on "Save Changes".
    

With these changes, our OAuth application is now ready, and we can configure it with SvelteKitAuth.

### Integrating Auth0 application with SvelteKit using SvelteKitAuth

In SvelteKit, authentication is typically handled using community-supported libraries and services. In this series of articles, we will be focusing on OAuth provider - **Auth0**

Before we begin, let's install two dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...,
  "@auth/core": "^0.34.1",
  "@auth/sveltekit": "^1.4.1"
}
```

There are two ways to integrate OAuth providers with our application:

1. **Using built-in OAuth providers**
    
    * A built-in OAuth provider typically refers to a service or platform that offers OAuth authentication as part of its core functionality.
        
    * These services are designed to handle the complexities of OAuth authentication, including token management, user sessions, and integration with various identity providers (like Auth0, Google, GitHub, etc.).
        
    * Integration with these built-in providers often involves using SDKs or libraries provided by the service, which abstracts much of the OAuth protocol details and makes integration straightforward.
        
2. **Using custom OAuth providers**
    
    * A custom OAuth provider refers to implementing OAuth authentication yourself or using a custom implementation not provided by a dedicated authentication service.
        
    * This approach requires you to set up your own OAuth server, which manages the OAuth flow, token generation, and user authentication.
        
    * Advantages of a custom OAuth provider include greater control over the authentication process, customization to fit specific application needs, and potentially lower cost (as you manage the infrastructure yourself).
        
    * However, implementing a custom OAuth provider requires a good understanding of OAuth protocols (like OAuth 2.0), security considerations (such as token management and secure communication), and may involve more development effort compared to using a built-in provider.
        

**Key Differences:**

* **Complexity and Maintenance:** Built-in OAuth providers typically abstract away much of the complexity of OAuth authentication, making integration easier and reducing maintenance overhead. Custom OAuth providers require more setup and ongoing maintenance.
    
* **Control and Customization:** Custom OAuth providers offer more control and customization options but require deeper technical expertise and effort to implement securely.
    
* **Integration Effort:** Built-in OAuth providers often provide SDKs and libraries that simplify integration with various platforms, whereas custom OAuth implementations require you to handle integration details manually.
    

In summary, the choice between a built-in OAuth provider and a custom OAuth provider depends on factors like your project's specific requirements, desired level of control, and your team's expertise in handling authentication protocols and security. For most applications, leveraging a well-established built-in OAuth provider like Auth0, Firebase Authentication, or others can often provide a good balance of ease of use, security, and functionality.
